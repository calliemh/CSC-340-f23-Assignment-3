        <p>We are thrilled to announce this month's Employee of the Month is none other than Magatha "Maggie" Christie.  Maggie has been with us for 9 years and is our second oldest cat here at Tabby Cat Coffee.  Maggie has won Employee of the Month for her exceptional customer service skills and for her efforts in responding to constructive criticism (She's finally stopped scratching the bulletin board!).  If you would like to congratulate Maggie, she can be found at her favorite scratching post.</p>
